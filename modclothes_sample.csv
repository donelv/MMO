I was nervous waiting for the package as it was my first modcloth purchase. When it came in the post I was very pleased to see it runs true to the sizing chart. I thought it fit perfectly (I'm usually a Aus 12 or L) and the fabric was lovely however not as thick as some have mentioned here but its not an issue at all, its still nice and bright. For me it was a bit short however thats due to me being tall, nothing a pair of stockings can fix. In summary if you are thinking about purchasing this dress go for it! it won't disappoint :)"

I love nearly everything I ordered, but this is really special. I can't believe I ordered something online that feels like it was custom made. It is simply gorgeousI'm a lot heavier now than I was for most of my adult life and feel very selfconscious in clothing that shows off curves, but this is just amazingly flattering. Huge volumes of cloth create an enormous skirt, but it is well constructed and sewn so that it isn't bunched up around the hips or stomach. The shoulders and bustline fit perfectly. The colors are really great too. I could go on and on, how much I love this dress. The brand is Bright and Beautiful and I wish ModCloth would identify the other items in this brand. It is the best fitting dress I've probably bought in my lifeand that includes when I weighed 40 pounds less! Make this in more fabrics, please!!"

It wasn't what I imagined  and therefore, what I thought I didn't want. It sat, ready to be returned in my entry way for days. While ModCloth does an awesome job of easy returns, I am very impatient. I asked my boyfriend if I should return it or not, and he said I was hoping you didn't. So I tried it on again, and started to rethink.  The material of the dress has a nice weight to it  not too heavy to add layers to it for colder seasons, but not too light to only make it wearable for the warmer seasons. With the weight, comes the structure of the dress  or at least I think so.  The structure doesn't necessarily WOW me, however, I'm relatively picky and I think I was expecting more of a fit to flare effect on the dress.  Otherwise, the dress fits and sits pretty well. To recap: I am a giant picky cry baby who nit picked this dress almost forcing myself to dislike it when it actually makes for a great staple in the closet. I will be getting it hemmed and investing in a thinner petticoat or slip to flare out the bottom, but when it comes down to it, I'm kicking my own butt for returning it. I would recommend this dress."

It looked so cute when I opened the box. The buttons are adorable. I love the collar. But then I put it on, and then I hated it. I was really excited about the pockets, but they ended up being the part I hated the most. The pockets make the dress stick out in a really unflattering place on me: right at my hips. I have wide hips so it made my top look even smaller than it already is, and my hips even bigger than they already are. I tried ironing the pockets flat as others suggested, but it didn't help. The dress is also short for me, hits me about midthigh. I am fairly tall, but I figured ordering the large would make the dress fall at a reasonable length. I really do love the collar still but I just can't get over how awkward the bottom of this looks on me. If it had pleats, I could probably jive with it because it would hide the pockets more.If you have wide hips, I wouldn't buy this dress. I'll be sending mine back."

First let me say: I love this dress, and I've worn it several times since I purchased it just over a month ago. I am usually a true 3X at Modcloth, but I often size up in dresses because I have a very large bust. VERY large. Since the fabric provides stretch I went with a 3X on this item, but honestly I might have even been able to size down. The 3X fits very comfortably, and if you don't want a dress that's bodycon I would order in your true size. However it does leave a little bit of room in the waist for me, though it still looks gorgeous. The dress is a heavy, sturdy material. The length hits me just below the knee and I'm tall, so it might be a little long on shorter women. I find the seams on the front of the dress very flattering, and it's a piece that's versatile enough I can wear it just about anywhere. The plus sizes seem to have more of a Vneck than the regular sizes, which I enjoy but people might want to be aware of. Overall I'm so glad that I took the chance on this item even with few plus size reviews, it's instantly become a staple for me. So comfortable!!"

I thought about returning it but I really liked it so I sewed some layers of black and white lace to the bottom to add a little bit of length and it looks perfect. I do recommend wearing a slip with the dress as the fabric is a little thin. Not in a poor quality way it is nice fabric I just think a slip helps the fabric lay nicer.

I had terrible lighting, but know that the dress really was a dark maroon color, really beautiful. It'll make your butt look AMAZING, btw. I got compliments on it all night! The dress, not my butt. Well, that too."

The material was ok, a little itchy on top, the slip was very clingy so use static spray.

The dress ends just below my knee and, as such, is a tad too long for my tastes.  But I've decided to keep it anyway because this is something that I can wear to work, and the sleeves can probably be altered pretty easily.  The medium fits me perfectly.

I wanted this dress so badly that I ordered the 2X when the 1X I needed was out of stock. I have a little extra room in the waist, but not enough to make it worth taking up.

The rest of the dress is a little big, but it's heavy weight means I will wear it in cooler weather with a shirt underneath or a sweater over it so it works out perfectly. It is very comfortable and suits work as well as casual functions. The pockets on the sides have been said to flare out, but it actually helps my lack of hips and makes me look more shapely. The buttons are getting a little loose after a few wears, but it should be easy to tighten them so it's not a problem. I own this dress in violet as well and the red is a little softer in comparison.

It is one of my favorite Modcloth purchases ever.  It has been my go to dress for the summer.  It's the easiest dress to just throw on and walk out the door.  I even wore it to the first time I've ever been to Disney World. I was really hoping Modcloth would make one in another color.  I was so excited to see this.  I put it on as soon as I got it and it's not the same.  It's shorter than the red/white one.  Short as in I'm 5'1 and it didn't even hit my knees.  Unfortunately, this is not work appropriate with my very large thighs covered in tattoos.  I wouldn't say it's tight but it feels a lot more fitted than the red/white and not as soft.  I'm a size L in every Modcloth brand dress/skirt I own. I actually looked at the tag to see if it was a L (it was).  I'm considering exchanging to see if the XL is a little longer on me but it may be too loose.  We shall see.  I gave it an average as I'm hoping there is still potential for this dress somehow. Sorry, I rambled a bit.  I just feel this is one of my most disappointing purchases."

I had ordered an XL as well because side zippers always spell trouble for busty gals, but while the zipper was able to zip, the buttonup front gaped terribly. I am thinking about sizing up to a 1X in the hopes that there will be enough material to sit smoothly over my bust, and then have the dress taken in by a tailor, but that is a lot of work for this dress, which is also dry clean only. The beautiful pattern is the only reason this one isn't going back immediately (although it may after some serious contemplation about how much work I want to put into it)."

The fabric is nice, but wrinkles very easily. I wore it out yesterday for the first time, and even though i ironed it before going, it wrinkled up after a couple of hours. I guess that what you can expect though, from a shirtlike fabric such as this one. I am quite tall, so the belted waist on the dress cuts in above my own waist, which is a bit annoying, but i can fix that fairly easily. I would have liked it to be a bit longer too, it cuts above my knees; but again that's due to being tall. I could have bought it bigger i suppose, but then it would have been too loose on the upper body. The buttons are a bit loose, and the holes for the buttons are too big, so they come undone constantly, but that's fixable. The stitching also seems a bit loose in places. Overall I'm happy with the dress, but not as much as I'd hoped."

So about the dress, its gorgeous! Dusty champagne color and very classy. Its the perfect length. Shoes were hard to find for it so I had a sash sewn on that matched my shoes and to give me the illusion of a waist. I also had the chest decoration taken in a little so that it didn't droop during my vows. I wish I had taken in the back decoration too since it drooped too and is bothersome in some of my wedding photos. The dress is very comfortable which was a huge plus for walking around a fair all day. I received so many compliments I lost count. Vintage is in and classy is never out of style.

I didn't notice this when I first tried it on so unfortunately it was past the return date when I wore it for a longer period of time.

The fabric is heavier and stiffer than expected, different than the other soft, yet sturdy Mata Trade dresses I've purchased.  Definitely worth the money, IMO.  It's a good dress for work or a special occasion.  The sleeves are a little tight as they get down toward my elbow, but nothing too annoying.  I'm just happy that I don't have to wear another cardigan.  Don't get me wrong, I love my cardis, but it's nice to just have sleeves in the cooler months too."

The basic color also makes it a great candidate for pairing with bright and fabulous shoes and/or tights.  The fit is just a little strange, though. I find this dress incredibly difficult to get on. The side zip is one of those goofy ones that doesn't go all the way up, (why do designers use those?) and it's a struggle to get this thing on over your head. It's worse taking it off, and I'm always afraid I'll damage it.  If you don't have flexible arms and shoulders, do not attempt! Once on it looks and feels fine, though it is just a tiny bit snug around the ribcage.  I have a fairly small ribcage, so buyer beware!

Would go great with flats and heels/wedges (short or tall). Pairing suggestions: You can dress this up or down easily with black, red, yellow, gray, burgundy, or beige/tan/taupe shoes.

My first purchase (Salty and Pepper Dress) went straight to the tailor because it was too big for an XS.  So I was a little bit hesitant about getting another dress, but since the reviews on this one were so good (I must confess I didn't read the reviews for the first purchase), I decided to give it a second chance. And I am so happy I did! The dress is in one word: PERFECT.  It fits like a glove. This IS what an XS should be like. The fabric is soft, but sill has some structure, the collar folds beautifully and you don't have to struggle to make it look perfect. It does it by itself (well almost). The color is so elegant, fun and eye catching.  This is definitely my new favorite dress.  Oh and with my cute dress I also got a free gift. How nice is that! I'll definitely come back for more (and will make sure to read the reviews first)."

The skirt is incredible, one of the prettiest things I've ever seen. The top is the issue. What everyone says about the sleeves is true, you feel like you can't raise your arms, and getting it off is a feat. I was afraid I was going to tear it and had to come up with some crazy contortionist maneuvers to get out of it. The material isn't lace, it's a glossy thick tulle, which has no stretch or give to it. The trim around the neckline stands out instead of laying flat and I can see how it could get stretched out and never go back. It's also not very flattering, it's sheer and shows off any sort of back or arm fat.The sizing is true but snug. I think this dress is best for small chested or petite women on top. If you are larger on top I'd recommend going a couple of sizes larger and having it altered."

The gold lace is quite prevalent and I agree with previous reviews that it makes the dress look less elegant than it could. Finally, despite the fact that it was two sizes too big, I still had a really hard time getting it off and had to get my fiance to help me peel it off without ripping it, even with the side zipper all the way open. Also because of the thickness of the material the zipper kept getting stuck. Mostly though I was surprised by how thick the lace it and how poofy the dress was overall. Definitely getting returned."

I am going to get it shortened to above the knee and wear sexy stocking with it for a glam pin up girl look. Fit perfect fit but definitely size up. I usually wear a 1X but the 3X fit this bod perfectoooo! Sightly scratchy cotton till you wash it, cold water and hang to dry...save the dry cleaning costs."

I also sized up from my normal Medium to a Large because I am kind of between the sizes right now and it's always easier to take it in later if needed (or just leave a little extra room for eating ;) ).  I can see this dress lasting for years! The material is thick enough to be substantial without making the body look any bigger, and the piping/seam details are very flattering as well.

The fabric is a little thin for my taste, and the belt may as well not even be there because, due to the cheap fabric, it looks bad tied.  I suggest a skinny waist belt instead (if only I had one, haha).  The arm holes are very big, which is funny, because, while I'm usually very comfortable in a S in my other MC dresses, I had to say a seriously moving prayer to get the side zipper up on this thing, and it felt tight along my notlarge bust line. It's not small enough to order a M, but then.. I don't know. It fits well everywhere else but the arm openings and chest.  I guess it wasn't made for me.I want to like this dress.  I'm really torn as to whether or not I should keep it.  If it weren't for the poofy sleeves that look ridiculous, I'd probably just say, OKAY, I'M GONNA LOSE THOSE FIVE POUNDS, YEAH! and use it to track my progress.  Even the buttons annoy me.  I like the heart shaped buttons, but they aren't even sewn on well, and I'll have to secure them myself if I do decide to keep this dress.Some positives:It makes my waist look small.  I consider myself to be thick waisted, so that is a welcomed feature.  That plus the lovely, longer length (hits me at the knee) makes me want to keep it.  I feel that with some cute Mary Janes and bright tights, this could be a really cute look for me.I think this review made me more confused as to my feelings for it.  :)"

The lace is quite delicate, so handle it gently!  Also, plan for fashion tape to prevent flopping of the delicate lace scallops along the neckline."

Not sure why on my smallish frame, but the ruffled bib part looks twice the size it does on that model. So then I thought, hmmm. Maybe it's just because it's all folded and flat and creased, maybe my hair wasn't quite right, or maybe my boobs are bigger because I'm about to get my period. Either way, it just didn't look right in the moment so I am hanging it up for now and will get back to it in a few days. Anyway, it's just not the Modclotharrivesinthemail experience we all hope for.

The skirt fit perfectly around my hips, and the length seemed good. I?ve ordered a 3X, but I?m guessing it will be too big. I have large arms, yet they are proportional for my size. Many designers don?t account for larger arms in plus sizes, so I do sometimes have a problem with arms/sleeves in dresses and tops. The sleeves in this dress seemed like they matched the proportions of the upper part of the dress. Meaning, the sleeves were about as tight as the rest of the torso."

My only qualm is that I bought this because the botanical dress in back stripes is my favorite modcloth purchase ever and I wanted to get it in a another color, and the fabric is quite a bit different.

So much of women's work attire is boring and unflattering, but this dress is a stark opposite! I got it because it looked like it would do the job, but it blew me away when I put it on. I am the farthest thing from curvaceous, but the way this dress is fitted and has some draping on the waist gave me a figure! Actual curves! No way! The neckline is modest enough for business but shows enough collarbone to be very flattering as well. Before I bought it I was nervous that it would be modest to the point of shapeless teacher, but it is not so. Because there is no zipper, it can be a bit of a wrestling match to put it on, but it's just stretchy enough that I don't worry about popping any seams. After a little tugging here and there, it fits beautifully and stays put without constricting. The color is gorgeous as well. It's a little bit lighter than pictured. The length is just perfect for a business setting; it hits me right at the center of my knee and compliments my legs really well with heels. I highly recommend this dress for anyone seeking polished, simple, and smart without looking robotic."

The lace was just as pretty as in the picture and although I read reviews about the fabric looking cheap, I didn't think this was the case at all. The lake color is just gorgeous! I also loved the length of the dress. Overall, I did really like the dress! I will say though, I agree with some past reviews about the zipper being difficult, even when the dress is off, the zipper is a bit finicky. Also, the dress poofed out  a lot more than in the picture...which is fine, but if you don't want a dress that is a bit poofy, I would consider something else. I normally am fine with some poof but for some reason the way this dress is designed it made me look a bit larger than I am, but I am sure that is not the case for everyone, whether they are my size or not. I did have to end up returning this, but mostly because the dress didn't fit and at the time, they were out of the next size up. This was my first purchase with modcloth, but the return was so easy and hassle free! I also was considering keeping the dress for a couple weeks, and decided against it, and the return still went SO easily. I wasn't even charged for shipping!

It's very comfortable and seriously flattering; I have gotten more compliments in this dress than in anything else I've ever worn. I wore it to an award ceremony and a fall wedding, and it was pitch perfect for both. Since the neckline is wrapstyle, you can even control how lowcut it is to a certain degree. Only complaint: one of the ruching seams tore after its first wear, but I got my dry cleaning place to sew it up decently. Still, I'm very glad I bought this dress!"

That being said, I wanted to write a helpful review for the woman who are over a size 12. I am a size 14 on a good day but usually am a size 16 which is the size of this dress that I am wearing in these pictures. The wedding I am wearing  it to is at the end of May so this is not the finished look that I will be wearing it was just for the sake of trying it on and writing a review. I love the dress but it can be a bit cupcake like on me especially at the waist where it poofs out a little too much (see pics). There are 3 layers of tule on my dress and I really think they could have gotten the same effect with less tule, especially on more curvy women and then with less tule it would be more slimming. The biggest complaint I have though is the neckline although it's not a deal breaker. When the dress is on me, it in no way matches the look of the model when it comes to the neckline. There is an awkward scalloped detail along the collar bone and so it does not sit flush against the skin. Whereas on the model, it is perfectly flush along her collarbone. I understand this is most likely because I have more broad shoulders and later breasts however, I think the designer should design and sew it in a way so that it looks very similar on all different kinds of figures. My favorite thing about the dress is the color. This color is exquisite and I really like the lace which makes it look really like a  black tie affair look. I also think the fabric is a nice quality. It is not itchy nor irritating and it is something I could wear all night without being annoyed by the fabric. Finally, the best part about the dress, my breasts are size 36 D and I DO NOT have to wear a bra in order for my girls to stay up and look perky. I think that's awesome because of the fact that if I did wear a normal bra, you would absolutely see the bra straps on this dress. I would recommend this look for curvier women but caution you from thinking that it will fit exactly as it fits on the model. If you purchase it, you have to find a way to make it work on you. I am keeping it and plan to wear it to the wedding in about a month so I will post the pictures of my final look after the wedding!"

Really this was the dress I was looking forward to opening the most, and when I tried it on, I was crushed. Having followed the advice to size up, I ordered a 1XL, typically I'm an XL. However I don't believe sizing down could have saved me on this one. While the top half fit a little large, and would have been fine, the torso went all the way to my hips, before kicking out into nothing land. It did not, on my body, in any way fit and flare. To be fair, I have a short torso, however the part of the dress that's supposed to flare out, on me was practically at my knees. It just sort of hung on me from the bust down. Had I ordered my usual XL I don't believe the buttons would have done up over my bust. Positives include a lovely darker yellow colour, silky fabric, and all round gorgeousness if you have a long torso.Sadly, I'm returning it."

During a sale I noticed it was available I pounced. What a GREAT DRESS!  I am usually a 3x in Modcloth items although some items tend to run small as the previous reviews reported with the rib cage area on this dress, so I sized up to 4x. When it arrived, I tried it on. I think I might have been able to wear the 3x. Although the photos all show the sleeves to be quite closely fitting even the ends and I didn't want them to be too tight my arms are a problem area. The 4x fits exactly right there and the ends of the sleeves don't cling. I feel loose and comfortable & I can move my arms easily. My bust fits a tick loose the waist more (which is where a 3x would have been okay but with an easy alteration or even a belt I can cinch that waist. It's got a nice weight to it and feels really good on, not itchy or stiff. It's a beautiful dress it makes me so happy just looking at it. The mesh is really fine so be careful of snagging it on things like hang nails, jewelry and such. My upper arms measure 16in at the heaviest part. This fits comfortably with a little room at the 3/4 length end."

This is the first time I bought a dress with this golden yellow/mustardy color and I must say I am certainly happy with it. Being mostly made of cotton, I am quite sure it will wrinkle after washing but I will wait to see what the outcome is after the first wash. The fit on the waist is smart and the sash is also good enough. You can always wear a different belt with it to jazz it up, in fact I plan on doing just that once I figure out what color would look good. Apart from that, the only downside would be that I just might have to wear some sort of slip underneath because the material seems to be a teeny bit see through. I didn't find that to be the case with this same dress that I bought in the cherry color but it really is not a big deal. The bust, waist, shoulder areas all fit fine. I usually buy XS but since this did not have that size, I bought a Small and I have no issues with the fit. This is a very smart dress, also has a 50s60s touch to it which is great.

I first saw this dress before I was engaged and loved it, and when I started shopping for a wedding dress after getting engaged I had to buy it to see if it would work. It?s even better than I expected! The detailing is so pretty and looks much more expensive than it is. The coloring is very nice, and true to pictures in my opinion. It really is a champaign and even ivory in parts so it?s great for a wedding dress if you don?t want bright white. The dress fit me perfectly  I ordered size 2. I feel like it was made to fit me it?s so perfect! No alternations needed. The dress hits right below my knee which is exactly what I wanted. The top is padded so you might not have to wear a bra. Only thing that I noticed is the top lace moved away from my chest when I move around but nothing a bit of doublesided fashion tape can?t fix. Seriously, I can?t say enough good things about the dress. When I put it on my sister and I had the moment when someone puts on the wedding dress that was meant to be. Love it!!"

The fabric does not provide stretch and it was slightly tight in my upper arms but not so much so that I would return it. I feel if I sized up, with my smaller chest, it would be baggy.

I settled on a small, which fits perfectly.  I agree with a lot of people who were a little let down by the button holes.  They will need to be reinforced unless you've got a small bust and (for me) the collar lays better with the top button undone.  The sleeves are poofy as was mentioned several times, but it's not bad enough to bother me (it's a little drafty).  This dress is really flattering for anyone with an hourglass shape, but be warned, the waist is small.  It zips up (left side) like a glove, but I would suggest sizing up if you like to have some extra breathing room in the rib/waist area.  Overall, I love this dress, and I love wearing it.  The length is perfect, but a little sheer so I don't leave the house without a slip and my boyfriend particularly likes the heartshaped buttons.

I bought it for my grandparents 50th anniversary party where I will be performing and thought this was a perfect stage dress. There are only 2 complaints. 1) The chest area is cut very small if you are larger chested like myself you will need to go up possibly an extra size. 2) like others have said the neck fits loosely. I am getting this part altered but for the price and since the chest isn't large I didn't expect the neck to be loose. The arms are rather slim but manageable and there we're a few frayed strings hanging from the arm and because it is not a cheap dress I expect more. All in all though none of these grievances are a deal breaker for me. I love the tone and look that this dress gives and when I showed my grandparents they loved it so it's a keeper!

The only slight drawback and I do mean slight... was that this fabric is a little thin so if you're wearing a bra with any lace or texture detail on it the texture will make the bust appear a bit bumpy.

The cap sleeves are perfect, as I prefer not baring my whole arm (sometimes hard to find in fitted dresses).  The back slit comes up a bit high, and like most tight clothing the skirt tends to ride up a bit, so I may tack the top closed just for my own peace of mind (or compulsively tug it down LOL). I love the Vneck, not too deep but still flirty and flattering.  Very high quality for the price."

While many fabrics are somewhat sheer, this dress's fabric is so loosely woven it's like mesh.  A cheaply made dress and not worth even the 40% off discount they offered.  Sizing is also way off between regular sizes and 'extended' sizes.  I have a coach tour  dress in 1x and decided too late to return it that it was too big.  If a 1x is too big (gappy even) then presumably the XL should be spot on right?  NOPE.  This XL is  super tight over the girls and as a result it hitches up awkwardly.  The material is a bit stretchy so it could be flattering if the size difference between an XL and a 1x was the same as between an L and an XL but alas, like many clothing manufacturers, to make extended sizes you just blew up the pattern excessively.

I tend to fall between a S and a M in Modcloth sizes, and I didn't want to risk buying the wrong size and then having it sell out (which as of right now, it has!), and so I bought it in both S and M. The photos are attached, the skirt of the M is a nice length (hits right above me knees), but it is too large for me in the waist and chest (in one of the pictures I am pinching the excess fabric in the waist, about 12 inches). The small is the perfect size in the body (again picture attached), though the skirt is shorter (about 23 inches above my knees). Since that doesn't bother me much, I'll be keeping the S and sending the M back. If you are like me and smaller in the chest, then the small is the way to go, it doesn't seem to squeeze too tight in the waist. But if you are a bit chestier, I'd go with the M. Also, if you want the dress to hit your knees, order the M and then have the top tailored to fit better.Another thing I noticed on BOTH dresses they keyhole in the back of the dress was not symmetrical, and zips more towards the left than the center. It isn't egregious enough for me to return it, but just something to keep in mind as it is a little strange and consistent on both dresses!Overall, I love this print, very jungle safari with hidden dinosaurs everywhere!

I range from a size 2 to size 6 depending on the store. The 2 fit perfectly in this case. The dress was cute, but the short length and material made it feel like was made for quincea?era rather than a wedding. It also fell at an unflattering length for someone as short as me (5'2). However, everyone I asked said they preferred how the Gilded Grace dress looked on me over the Sparkling Celebration dress. I ultimately ended up returning both for something with a more delicate lace."

Also, I'm 5'5'', and often have problems with dresses of this length running too long on me, but it hits right below the knee  a respectable length for a family wedding (which is where this will be worn). The fabric itself also feels like good quality. The price is right now that it's on sale. What I dislike about this dress: the reviews mentioning the sticky zipper are spot on. I'm shocked that this has been an issue since the dress was released and has never been resolved. According to the size chart, I am an inbetweenie, so I erred toward the larger size to accomodate potential zipper issues.

Also, the length is great  I'm 5'9 and it hits at the knee. The only thing I?m somewhat frustrated with is the material ? I know this will be a real pain to keep from wrinkling. Perhaps in the future a blend of cotton with polyester may be the answer. This was my very first purchase from ModCloth, and I'm very pleased. Here?s to hoping ModCloth will start carrying more plus sizes in other styles!"

The skirt part of the dress seemed to be a lot of fabric and the shoulders were loose. My solution: washing it and putting it the dryer at a medium heat (even though the tag says handwash and line dry). It really brought the dress together. Now it fits perfectly. Even the length was taken up a little.

The dress fits perfectly like a glove!  The material is nice it's thin enough for summer, yet thick enough for winter.  Length is perfect.  I can't imagine this dress not flattering every figure!  If you're delaying on getting this dress get it today I'm already trying to decide which color I want next (i'm leaning towards winter)!"
